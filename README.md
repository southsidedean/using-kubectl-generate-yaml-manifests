# Using `kubectl` to Generate YAML Manifests
**Tom Dean - 4/26/2023**

## Introduction

I'm preparing to take the #CKAD and #CKA exams, and one area I need to build my #k8s muscles is using the `kubectl` command imperatively to create #Kubernetes manifests for #declarative deployment.

Given that both #exams are #exercises where every second counts, this skill facilitates the rapid and consistent generation of #YAML manifests, that can quickly be edited and deployed.

I was fortunate to come across Adrien Trouillaud's excellent Medium article, "Imperative vs. Declarative — a Kubernetes Tutorial" while researching this topic. Adrien's article is a comprehensive tutorial on how to leverage the #imperative approach to creating objects in Kubernetes.

In this tutorial, we're going to examine how we can use the kubectl command imperatively to create some common objects as YAML manifests.
